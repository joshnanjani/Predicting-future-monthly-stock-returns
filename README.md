# Predicting future monthly stock return

•	Obtained Price and volume & financial results data from Wharton Research Data Services database (WRDS)\
•	Wrangled price, volume data extensively to create features such as Last_6M change, Volume relativity\
•	Performed text mining on ticker & company name information to connect price & financial results data sets\
•	Predicted positive vs negative monthly stock returns with 61% accuracy using logistic regression\
•	Explored the effects of scaling data. Found that scaling the predictors decreases the RMSE by 1.2%\
•	Currently, working more on modeling and exploring other derived variables

•	Please see the project outline and a detailed list of all derived variables at Project Report and short notes (WIP).docx\
